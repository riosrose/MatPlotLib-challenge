# MatPlotLib-challenge


=======
UCB Data Analytics-Challenge 5 

CHALLENGE PURPOSE : In this challenge, demonstrates use of  Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset.

# References
The dataset used mouse_metadata and study_results, were megered.  
Dataset: 
         The dataset is referanced and leveraged directly in xxxxxxxxxxxx. Data file is in a xxxxxxxxxxxx format. 
                  
# Code
This project is located in git hub comprised of : 
 - Pymaceuticals ( folder) 
   -- pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb (notebook) 
   -- data (sets)
    ---  mouse_metadata
    ---  study_results
- ReadMe file  

Source Code stored in this repo to MatPlotLib-challenge project that used 2 data sets : mouse_metadata and study_results.Subsequently creating new dataframes for further use:  
**combined_df
**cleaned_data_df
**merged_data_df 
# Resources.. 
         utilized for support with debugging, clarifications of code : Xpert Learning, Gemini AI where needed and https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html .

 - Note Unresolved challenge: My results  for the Boxplot visual DO NOT MATCH starter code results. I couln't resolve after walking my code for several days.
